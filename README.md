EMY Thesis Scripts
These scripts were written to analyse metabolomics (and OTU) data, obtained in 2016/2016, from various tissues of the African
Turquoise Killifish. They are very specific to the filetype/data structure we were using at the time.
They are rather primitive, but a good document of my first ventures into coding.
