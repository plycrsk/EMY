EMY Thesis Scripts
These scripts were written to analyse metabolomics data, obtained in 2016/2017, from various tissues of the African
Turquoise Killifish.

The scripts are summarised as follows:
1. Array manipulation of raw data, to allow for appropriate statistical tests to be run. Includes False Discovery Rate control, important when analysing big data.
2. Generation of plots for use in presentations
3. Rearranging data for input into online tool (PIUMet)
4. Generating visual networks using data obtained from PIUMet tool.
